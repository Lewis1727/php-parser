# WebbyLab (web application)

Application created for WebbyLab

## Getting Started
This application requires you to create your own movies database. The main feature is adding movies from .docx files, by parsing it in php. The UI is very clear and simple. Although there are some things, that could be improved so that exceptions were handled.

### Prerequisites
This application is simple, but to run it you need to have php local server and other requirements , so in my case I used LEMP [stack](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-nginx-mysql-php-lemp-stack-ubuntu-18-04):
* PHP 7.0+
* local web server (NGINX in my case)
* MySql Database

### Installing
```
[PHP 7](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php)
```
```
[NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/docs/install.html) - install&configure
```
```
[MySql](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) - better find how to install and set up mysql on your system
```
